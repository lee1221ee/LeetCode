# 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock
## Problem Description
You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i`<sup>`th`</sup> day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a **single day** to buy one stock and choosing a **different day in the future** to sell that stock.

Return *the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction*. If you cannot achieve any profit, return `0`.

Example 1:
```
Input: prices = [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-1 = 5.
Note that buying on day 2 and selling on day 1 is not allowed because you must buy before you sell.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: prices = [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transactions are done and the max profit = 0.
```

## Analysis and Code
+ Time - O(n)
+ 在 Array 中持續比較更新最小值的價格
+ 根據當前價格減去最小價格的到today_profit
+ today_profit 是否超過之前的最大 profit

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxProfit(vector<int>& prices) {
        int min_price = INT_MAX;
        int max_profit = 0;
        int today_profit = 0;
        for(int i = 0;i < prices.size();i++)
        {
            if(prices[i] < min_price)
                min_price = prices[i];
            today_profit = prices[i] - min_price;
            if(today_profit > max_profit)
                max_profit = today_profit;
        }
        return max_profit;
    }
};
```
