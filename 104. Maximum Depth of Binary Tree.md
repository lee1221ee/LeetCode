# 104. Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

## Problem Description

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return _its maximum depth_.

A binary tree's **maximum depth** is the number of nodes along the longest path from the root node down to the farthest leaf node.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = [1,null,2]
Output: 2
```

## Analysis and Code

參考這個[解析](https://leetcode.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/discuss/1770060/C%2B%2B-oror-Recursive-oror-DFS-oror-Example-Dry-Run-oror-Well-Explained)

- Recursive (DFS)
- TC - O(num of nodes) as we are traversing all the nodes of the tree
- SC - O(1) without taking the implicit recursive stack into consideration

```C++
class Solution {
public:
    int maxDepth(TreeNode* root) {
        if(!root) return 0;
        int max_left = maxDepth(root -> left);
        int max_right = maxDepth(root -> right);
        return max(max_left, max_right) + 1;
    }
};
```
